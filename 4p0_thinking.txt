Notes: I DO NOT WANT TO JOB SWAP THE ORIGINAL SCIENTISTS

DISTRICTS
	storage district
		increases storage still, no longer needs seperate event, can apply the coubtry modifier
			storage increases based on integrated kugelblitz
		upgrades to have a logistic job when the frame is upgraded, gives 100 Organizer jobs which reduce pop scaling effect
		no building slot
		uncapped
	embassy district
		gives influence
		1 building slot: government only
		capped based on population
	astral district
		gives astral thread jobs directly, equal to a physicians only district
			works, but they dont get efficiency
			(have the deposit give astral researchers the efficiency bonus if the efficiency building is preset )
		1 building slot: physics, research
		capped based on frame size
	archeology support district
		gives archeologists directly, equal to a biology only district
			(see notes on astral district)
		1 building slot: biology, research
		single cap, only appears if there is an outpost on a relic world
		jobs from zone multiplies based on number of relic outposts
	knight district
		gives knight jobs equal to habitat zone
		needs decision origins knights
		when created, moves the keep to the zone
		SHARED CAP: capped by number of outposts, use the orytka way and on_megastructure_built(check with ttft if that can work)
		1 building slot: knights
	resort district
		gives resort worker jobs
		1 building: only allows the 6 available for the attraction district
		SHARED CAP: capped by number of outposts

	museum district
		single cap
		gives clerks

	patron district

	on hold:
		MBRAIN




DECISIONS
	enclave integration
		double check it works
	resort section
		scrapped for the new district
	vivarium

	PD UNIQUES:
		maybe??? put into a district with a cap of 1 so it can have buildings
		CRYSTAL
			keep as is
		ELUDIUM
			keep as is
		BIOSYNTH
			copy the others
			the deposit should give biosynth engineer jobs to make living metal

		no change (has deposit):
			sentry
			hyperassembly yard
			kugelblitz
			stratcoordination
			science nexus
			interstellar assembly
			mega art
		no change
			quantum catapult
			lathe
			psychic beacon
			aetherophasic mirror
			systemcraft printer
