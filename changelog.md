# New Features 
Matrioshka Brain Integration:
- Lets you create a built-in MBrain
- Decision spawns a mega, that when upgraded disappears and grants the ability to make Mbrain districts
- Completing the mega also grants 1 uplink at the cost of 500 energy upkeep (a bargain)
Matrioshka Brain Districts:
- Expensive with high upkeep, but unlimited
- Grants 1/8 an uplink per district
- With Voidframe this goes up 1/7 -> 1/6 -> 1/5 -> 1/4 (depending on tech level)
