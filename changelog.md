# New Stuff
- Integration of the galactic archives museum buildings
  - This also disallows the building to be built on the frame, just use the decision.
  - This is to save on critical building slots.
- THE FRAME LATHE (long section)
  - Unlock this by getting the tech, building the Initial Frame Lathe core building, and then taking the decision.
  - Managing lathe upgrades is done via decision on the frame
    - Upgrading the lathe building increases the number of lathe districts and lathe upgrades
  - The normal lathe is still available to the frame, but you cannot have both
  - There are some significant differences
    - You cannot purge your primary species
    - You cannot spare specific members of a species and purge the rest, it is all or nothing
    - The frame's innate purge speed bonus is reduced by 75%
  - A situation log repeats all the above
