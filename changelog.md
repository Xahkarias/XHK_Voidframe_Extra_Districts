# Changes
* Embassy Deposit is now automatically added to the Frameworld when the prerequisite tech is researched.
* Embassy deposit effects have been cleaned up, you only see the district tooltip relevant to your voidframe upgrade level (or no level if no voidframe)
* Internal name of the base Embassy district has been changed for compatibility. This will result in non-ACOT embassy districts needing to be rebuilt if the save is from v3.12
