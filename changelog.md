# New Features 
# Districts
* Merged my Knights of the Toxic Frameworld / Ancient Knights of the Toxic Frameworld
    - If used with Daemonic Incursion, allows knights to be added to the frameworld. 
    - Knights will level up if Ancient Cache of Knights is installed. 
* Added Ultra-Exotics district, to create Planetary Diversity Unique World resources on the Frame
    - Requires PD Unique Worlds (duh)
    - Once the Gigas GLUE technology is unlocked, and a unique world is within your borders, can use a decision on the frame to unlock the district and the Eludium research tree.
# Deposits
* Added Battle Thrall jobs to the Battle Thrall Complex. Number scales based on frame upgrade level.
# Integrated Megas
* Added decision to add Aetherophastic Mirror surrounding the frame. Make sure you know what you are doing.
* Added more attack moon / planetcraft decisions, allowing for a total of 8 moon printers and 2 planet printers.
* Added decision to add a Systemcraft Printer, if Stellar Manipulation is installed.
* Added decision to spawn a Synaptic Lathe next to the frame.
* Added decision to spawn a Labyrinth of Abstraction (needs Beyond the Shroud)

# Changes
* Removed frameworld storage building.
* Storage District and Astral District storage modifiers are now handled via a country modifier that ticks when a district is built / destroyed or a month passes.
* Astral District is now locked behind getting the final level of the Astral Siphon building.
* Astral Deposit (unlocks the Astral District) is automatically added to the frame once unlocked.
* Embassy Deposit is now automatically added to the Frameworld when the prerequisite tech is researched.
* Embassy deposit effects have been cleaned up, you only see the district tooltip relevant to your voidframe upgrade level (or base level if no voidframe).
* Internal name of the base Embassy district has been changed for compatibility. This will result in non-ACOT embassy districts needing to be rebuilt if the save is from v3.12.
* Reorganized the spawn locations of the moon and planet printers to make them more organized.
* Added some Frameworld events / trigger overrides.
