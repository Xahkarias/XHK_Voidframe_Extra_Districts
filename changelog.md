# Changes 
* Added planetary mass district, unlocked with Hyperefficient Telluric Dismantling
* Added stellar plasma districts (requires Stellar Manipulation Rewrite)
* ACOT / AOT variations for above are also provided (requires Voidframe) (AOT districts will not be available until AOT updates)

# Fix
* Removed incorrect text in astral district that claimed that astral thread storage increases (it does not due to code limitations)
