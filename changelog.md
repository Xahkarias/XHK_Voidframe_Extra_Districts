# New Features 
* Updated to have compatibility with PD Unique's Crystal world
    - Works similarly to the eludium world
* Added extra compatibility with nanite expansion continued:
    - Confirmed that universal / universal mass / universal mega constructor building has compat with normal frame and voidframe
* Added enclave spawning capability to the Ancient Hive, Prime Machines, and Deep Rock Galactic enclaves from New Enclaves Revived
* Added enclave invite capability to Archivists from Forgotten History
    - Note that this overrides the Archivists in More Enclaves with more functionality (same mod author). This just makes it so that the decision works no matter which mod you have.  
* Added nanite district
    - Requires Nanite Expansion Continued, disabled if ACOT is loaded
    - Adds nanite jobs from nanite expansion, scales in job number and upkeep like the Nanite Fabricator Building

# Changes
* Nerfed Eludium output of the PD refiner jobs from 4->1, as that was ridiculous what was I thinking lol.

# Bugfixes
* Spa deposit will now deactivate bonuses and penalties if the owner loses the toxic bath civic.
