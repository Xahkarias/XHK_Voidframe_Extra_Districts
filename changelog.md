# IMPORTANT NOTE:
MERGER OF RULES IS NOW REQUIRED

# Changes
FYI: there are some side effects to integrating megas as a deposit + ambient object
- Gigas will not recognize it as an existing mega/giga
  - this will still count for unlocking requirements for ascension perks / techs
  - but will not count for increasing tech drop rates (like how mega engineering increases drop rate if you have a mega in your land)
- all ambient models will be mammallian + blue
  - technically all the megas I am working with do not have special models per ship type, so you wont notice
  - but the lights will change color to blue
- but they are all reverse compatible

Changed Integrated Science Nexus to spawn ambient object + deposit at the end. 
- restricted to lvl 3 science nexus (only missing 50 science of each type, youll be fine)
Changed Integrated Strategic Coordination Center to spawn ambient object + deposit at the end. 
Changed Integrated Sentry Array to spawn ambient object + deposit at the end. 
Changed Integrated Mega Art Installation to spawn ambient object + deposit at level 3.
- to get level 4, use the decision on the frame.

Made all mega spawning respect frameworld major upgrade status (ie: if you are installing the penrose sphere, you cannot create an art installation)

# Other
Added compatibility fix with EUTAB to allow machine world specific buildings to be built on the frame.

# Bugfixes
Swapped the effect and description text for the Hyperstructural decision
