# New Stuff
- Added Iodizium deposit moving
  - Use the decision on a owned celestial body that has an iodizium deposit
  - Will remove the resource, and add 1 iodizium miner job to the frame
- Added vanilla nanite district
  - Vanilla means no Nanite Expansion mod (will disable itself for the nanite expansion mod if needed)
  - Nanite districts are locked behind either completing the Nanotech tradition, or taking Master Builders ascension perk
  - If frame is nanite upgraded, district will produce extra nanites
