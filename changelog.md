# New Features 
# Integrated Megas
* Allows the invitation of the Curator and Artisan Enclaves to the Frame system (spawns their station next to the frame)
- Needs >90 trust and >75 size frame
- Can only be invited if there is still a surviving enclave (no resurrecting them)

# Big Changes (Frame Knights Rework Part 2)
* The Toxic God relic gives knight districts +1 knight job.
* Knight districts are capped at 3 + 5% of frame size
* Amount of knights from outposts increased from 0.2 to 0.5
- The above changes, along with the changes before, seek to make knights balanced while rewarding
- Knights can be gotten from:
    - Base amount from the keep
    - Base amount from toxic god planetary features
    - Scaling amount of 0.25 / outpost
    - From knight districts, once the relic is attained, at 1 job per 20 frame size
