# New Stuff
Added Nicol Dyson Beam to the frame system
- IN THE INTEREST OF BALANCE AND PLAUSIBILITY, THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS
- 1) This is not integrated directly into the frame, that would look really stupid
- 2) This only removes some of the restrictions on the construction, so you can build it in the frame system
- 3) It still requires a class A or B star, so you need to find a way to put that in the frame system (COUGH ACOT)

Added new deposit which makes it easier to manage the Crimon Throng crisis (from the mod with the same name)
- Deposit reduces infectivity by 10%
- Deposit also increases number of people captured when looking for infected
- Deposit costs go away once the cure is developed

Integrated my other mod: Voidframe Planetary Wonders

# Changes
Changed interstellar assembly to use deposit + ambient method

# Other
Increased the y coordinate of several ambient megas, to help them stand out more from the frame.

# Bugfixes
Added some gating flags to spawning enclaves (doesnt affect anyone unless you also use Voidframe and Ancient Empire)

Bugs fixed inherited from Voidframe Planetary Wonders:
- fixed not being able to research the galactic model / panopticon / nostalgia paradise on a frame
