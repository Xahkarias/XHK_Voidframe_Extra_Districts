# New Features 
* Merged my Knights of the Toxic Frameworld / Ancient Knights of the Toxic Frameworld
    If used with Daemonic Incursion, allows knights to be added to the frameworld. 
    Knights will level up if Ancient Cache of Knights is installed. 
* Added Battle Thrall jobs to the Battle Thrall Complex. Number scales based on frame upgrade level

# Changes
* Astral District is now locked behind getting the final level of the Astral Siphon building.
* Astral Deposit (unlocks the Astral District) is automatically added to the frame once unlocked.
* Embassy Deposit is now automatically added to the Frameworld when the prerequisite tech is researched.
* Embassy deposit effects have been cleaned up, you only see the district tooltip relevant to your voidframe upgrade level (or no level if no voidframe)
* Internal name of the base Embassy district has been changed for compatibility. This will result in non-ACOT embassy districts needing to be rebuilt if the save is from v3.12
