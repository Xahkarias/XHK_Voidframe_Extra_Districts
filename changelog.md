# New Stuff
- A psuedo-orbital ring around the frame
  - for balance purposes it does not accept most buildings / modules, only custom made ones
    - and some vanilla ones that I dont want to override: Resource Silos, Hydroponic Bays, Crew Quarters, Storm stuff
    - Modules:
      - Shipyards: worth 3 normal shipyards
      - Hatchery: worth 3 normal hatcherys
        - if the vivarium upgrade is on the frame, gives +10 hatcheries
        - has a beastport variation
        - Modders Note: The large number of hatcheries is so you can make a psuedo-mega-hatchery
    - buildings:
      - Detection array: +4 detection, +1 sensor range
        - short range means its only good at protecting the frame and adjacent systems
      - hatchery / shipyard booster: increases build / clone speed by 30%
