# Big Changes (Frame Knights Rework Part 2)
* The Toxic God relic gives knight districts +1 knight job.
* Knight districts are capped at 3 + 5% of frame size
- The above changes, along with the changes before, seek to make knights balanced while rewarding
- Knights can be gotten from:
    - Base amount from the keep
    - Base amount from toxic god planetary features
    - Scaling amount of 0.2 / outpost
    - From knight districts, once the relic is attained, at 1 job per 20 frame size
