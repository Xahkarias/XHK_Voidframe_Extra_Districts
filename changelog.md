# New Stuff
Added Nicol Dyson Beam to the frame system
- IN THE INTEREST OF BALANCE AND PLAUSIBILITY, THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS
- 1) This is not integrated directly into the frame, that would look really stupid
- 2) This only removes some of the restrictions on the construction, so you can build it in the frame system
- 3) It still requires a class A or B star, so you need to find a way to put another star in the frame system (COUGH ACOT)

Added new deposit which makes it easier to manage the Crimon Throng crisis (from the mod with the same name)
- Deposit reduces infectivity by 10%
- Deposit also increases number of people captured when looking for infected
- Deposit costs go away once the cure is developed

Integrated my other mod: Voidframe Planetary Wonders

# Changes
Changed interstellar assembly to use deposit + ambient method

Added new compatibility / features to the Planetary Computer Upgrade
- With Voidframe, the researcher jobs given are based on the level of the district: if you have phanon research districts, you get phanon researchers 
    - This does mean that if you dont have a research district, it gives no researcher jobs (but you have a research district right??)
- Adds an Extradimensional Researcher job + 1 zro upkeep per district, if the planet decision from the galactic community resolution is active

# Other
Increased the y coordinate of several ambient megas, to help them stand out more from the frame.

# Bugfixes
Added some gating flags to spawning enclaves (doesnt affect anyone unless you also use Voidframe and Ancient Empire)

Bugs fixed inherited from Voidframe Planetary Wonders:
- fixed not being able to research the galactic model / panopticon / nostalgia paradise on a frame
    * note: the panopticon tech requires the penal colony tech. This is pretty much a dead tech, as there is no benefit. But you will need this tech to get the panopticon tech.
- fixed not being able to add the space elevator deposits to the frame
- fixed being able to build space elevator + habitat related stuff on the frame
