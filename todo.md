    - beyond the shroud labyrinth integration - waiting on my gigas pr to be merged

    -find some way to make the frameworld grow lots of space fauna

    new enclaves revived: shrouds children
        shroud coven
        salvager

- ACOT versions of PD unique districts - because it ANNOYS ME WHEN THEY DONT MATCH THE OTHER DISTRICT COLORS
- iodizium deposit consuming -> move to frame
- something with extra defenses, maybe asteroid arty spawner?

- Planetary defense nexus (will be slightly nerfed compared to normal, but will have districts to compensate)
- make frameworld able to get cosmic storm deposits

REMINDER ON HOW TO DEPOSIT:
    NEED TO MAKE:
        deposit
        decision to add deposit
        localisation for deposit and decision
        icons for deposit and decision

SAVE ALL IMAGES WITH BC2 LINEAR



fortress = 4 soldier
dm = 2  acotsoldier / 2 dm soldier  2*12 / 2*6
de = 4 acot     4*12 
pe = 2 phanon       2*18
se = 2 stellarite      2*36

STEPS FOR MEGA INTEGRATION:
    decision to spawn initial mega          
    deposit

    megas to update                         
    update all references to the mega    
    art for deposit

    localization for everthing           
    notification events                     

STUFF TO INTEGRATE
