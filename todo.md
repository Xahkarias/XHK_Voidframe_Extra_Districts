    - beyond the shroud labyrinth integration - waiting on my gigas pr to be merged
    new enclaves revived: shrouds children
        shroud coven
        salvager

- ACOT versions of PD unique districts - because it ANNOYS ME WHEN THEY DONT MATCH THE OTHER DISTRICT COLORS
- iodizium deposit consuming -> move to frame
- something with extra defenses, maybe asteroid arty spawner?

- Planetary defense nexus (will be slightly nerfed compared to normal, but will have districts to compensate)




- kugelblitz integration (makes all resource districts better)
- (with acot) spawn uncolonizable ringworld segments, gives a deposit with +40 districts and +2 planetary outposts
- precursor orbital ring on frameoutposts in capital system

REMINDER ON HOW TO DEPOSIT:
    NEED TO MAKE:
        deposit
        decision to add deposit
        localisation for deposit and decision
        icons for deposit and decision

SAVE ALL IMAGES WITH BC2 LINEAR

STEPS FOR MEGA INTEGRATION:
    decision to spawn initial mega          
    deposit                                            
    ambient object for final mega           
    megas to update                         
    update all references to the mega    
    art for deposit                         
    art for decision                        
    localization for everthing              
    notification events                     

STUFF TO INTEGRATE
    maybe psibeacon
